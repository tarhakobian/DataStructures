Data Structures Implementation

This project implements several important and widely used data structures in Java. These data structures are designed to provide efficient ways of managing and manipulating data in your Java applications.

## Implemented Data Structures

1. **Double Linked List:** A doubly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the previous and next elements in the sequence.

2. **Stack:** A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, making it ideal for managing function calls, parsing expressions, and more.

3. **Queue:** A queue is another linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, making it useful for managing tasks, scheduling, and data processing.

4. **Blocking Queue:** A blocking queue is an extension of the standard queue data structure with blocking operations that provide synchronization and thread safety.

5. **HashMap:** A HashMap is a data structure that provides key-value pair storage and fast retrieval based on keys. It is commonly used for caching and indexing.
